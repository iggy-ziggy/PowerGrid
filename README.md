# PowerGrid

## Description

An app to locate alternative fuel source's for vehicles based on your area. When you search for fuel locations then you're presented with a list of locations that you can choose from. When you switch to map view then you will see markers on your map of fuel locations.

### Skills Used

We used Foundation's framework to accelerate the prototyping phase.\
The NREL API was used to locate electric vehicle charging stations, and JavaScript appends these results dynamically to the page.\
With the Google Maps API we were able to create map markers for each of these results and show them on a map within a modal. The modal can be accessed with a button click.\
